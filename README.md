## Usage

1. Ensure AutoHDR is enabled in Windows 11 settings.
2. Manually enable HDR by pressing `Win+Alt+B` in Windows 11.
3. Run your game.
4. To verify AutoHDR is working, open the Xbox Game Bar, navigate to the HDR Intensity Slider, and adjust it. If the brightness shifts while adjusting the slider, AutoHDR is functioning.
5. For automatic HDR toggling for any process/game, consider using [PyAutoActions](https://github.com/7gxycn08/PyAutoActions/).
